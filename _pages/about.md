# Who am I?

I'm a software engineer. 
I took a master degree in 2016 in computer vision field. 
[My lab](http://mm.cs.uec.ac.jp/) is quite famous but too bad, 
i didn't get any success in researching field. 
So i quit the academic route and become an engineer.

My work mainly focus on computer vision and machine learning.
Sometime i have to work with some embedded device too.

This blog is where i store my cheat-sheet, my learning note, my point-of-view. 

# My hobby

I used to go to gym, running, weight-lifting a lot but after getting inguinal hernia, 
I quit training and start Aquarium and playing computer game in my free-time.
