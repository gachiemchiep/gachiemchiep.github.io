# Detail

Found some interesting post on image-sensors-world: [Source](http://image-sensors-world.blogspot.com/2019/06/image-sensor-explained-in-11min.html) .

IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society has recently opened its [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmnrdxAhy8LHpGmt-TcTmYg). This channel currently contains several interesting videos on different topics

[Prof Makoto Ikeda](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/people000381.html) from Tokyo University managed to squeeze an amazing amount of info in just over 11min video about image sensors:

[![VLSIx 2016: Image Sensors Makoto Ikeda](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lZS3lX5Cxe0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZS3lX5Cxe0&t=600s "Image Sensors Makoto Ikeda")

For software developer like myself, the following information is useful:

* CMOS camera have several advantages over CCD, such as higher bandwidth
* Rolling shutter camera will have blur when taking moving object picture. Global shutter won't
* Key performance of image sensor are as follow:
  * Sensitivity [V/lx-s] : Quantum efficiency (QE), Conversion gain [V/e-], Fill factor
  * Noise : PD: Dark current, Optical shot Noise, AMP: Reset noise, 1/f noise, thermal noise, FPS (pixel/column)
  * Dynamic Range
  * Spatial resolution
  * Frame rate

Industrial camera should always have the above performance parameters. You can go to [Basler camera homepage](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/products/cameras/area-scan-cameras/ace/aca640-300gm/) and take a look.

# Others (not useful)

[Prof Makoto Ikeda](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/people000381.html) also uploaded other talk too. But this talk is mainly focusing on sensor's circuit.

[![Circuit Contributions to Performance of Imagers Makoto Ikeda](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Rl_lZmm6SVc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl_lZmm6SVc "Image Sensors Makoto Ikeda")

Found this PDF on internet, mainly focusing on sensor's circuit designing too.
