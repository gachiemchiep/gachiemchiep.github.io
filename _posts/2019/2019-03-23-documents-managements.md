## Situation

My current situtation is as followed:

1. Having hundreds of document files ( in pdf, epub, chm, etc)
2. Personal use 
3. All of document files need to be group, tagged and annotated
4. Share between personal devices using the cloud

## Approaches

### Using document management system (DMS)

There're several DMS solution such as [i-librarian](https://i-librarian.net) , [mayan-ems](https://www.mayan-edms.com/demo/), [paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless), [OpenKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenKM), etc . See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system) for a list of DMS system. 

Advantages : 

1. Have tons of function
2. product-level software
3. Can scale out easily

Disadvantages:

1. Need a server with strong firewall and security ( in self-hosted case)
2. Need money ( in cloud case)

**Note:** [i-librarian](https://i-librarian.net) and [mayan-ems](https://www.mayan-edms.com/demo/) are both great DMS software. 

### Using researcher support service

[Zetore](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/newsfeed) are two famous researcher support service. 

Advantages :

1. Can import articles from browser directly into storage

Disadvantages :

1. Limit cloud storage (Zotero: 300MB, Mendeley: 2GB)
2. Use built-in pdf editor which save annotation in private format
3. Lack of tagging and document sorting function

### Final solution

There isn't any software or service that could sastify my requirement, so i end up using alternative approach.

1. For short read time document such as research paper, keep using Mendeley
2. For long read time document such as book, tutorial, use "Calibre" + "Dropbox" + "FoxitReader" combination.

Reason : annotations exported by Mendeley were not read correctly by other software. This will lead to loss of information and increase total learning time.

### Final solution in detail
