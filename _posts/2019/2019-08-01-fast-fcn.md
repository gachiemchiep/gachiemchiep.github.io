## Summary

* Better accuracy , higher fps 

mIoU = 53.1% in Pascal Context dataset

* source code come with MIT license, can be used in commercial

The author is generous to give the source code as MIT license at [github](https://github.com/wuhuikai/FastFCN). At August 2019, He's also very active on the github page too. Unlike other project where tons of issue are left there, in this project there're no issue left. Amazing

## Personal thinking 

Amazing work.
