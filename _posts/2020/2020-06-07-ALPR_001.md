# 1. Datasets

Some datasets can be used to train Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR).

* [Caltech Cars](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/html-files/archive.html)
* [English License Plate](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/projects/LicensePlates/english/baza_slika.zip)
* [UCSD-Stills (UCSD car dataset)](http://vision.ucsd.edu/belongie-grp/research/carRec/car_data.html)
* [UFPR-ALPR](http://www.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/UFPR-ALPR.zip)
* [CCPD: Chinese City Parking Dataset](https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD)
* [Holistic Recognition of Low Quality License Plates by CNN using Track Annotated Data](https://medusa.fit.vutbr.cz/traffic/research-topics/general-traffic-analysis/holistic-recognition-of-low-quality-license-plates-by-cnn-using-track-annotated-data-iwt4s-avss-2017/)
* [OpenALPR benchmark](https://github.com/openalpr/benchmarks/tree/master/endtoend/)
* [500 Images of the Rear View](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/projects/LicensePlates/english/results.shtml)


A quick glances at those datasets is :

In a short word, the following datasets are large enough to be used in building ALPR

* [UFPR-ALPR](http://www.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/UFPR-ALPR.zip)           : For US license plate
* [CCPD: Chinese City Parking Dataset](https://github.com/detectRecog/CCPD) : For chinese license plate

There're other sites that can we use to mined license plate images such as:

* [Olavâ€™s License Plate Pictures](http://www.olavsplates.com/)
* [Plates Mania](http://platesmania.com/)  : This is the recommeded
* [License Plate Portal](http://plates.portal.free.fr/)

# 2. Softwares

The following open-source softwares are available to use in commercial ALPR: 

* [ultimateALPR-SDK](https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/ultimateALPR-SDK/blob/master/LICENSE) : Run very fast even for embedded devices(105fps on GTX 1070, 47fps on Snapdragon 855, 12fps on Raspberry Pi 4) . The source code can run locally. And we need to contact the sale for commercial license. 
* [openalpr](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr) : The most famous ALPR software. It was built on opencv and tesseract, so when comparing to deep learning approach it is not that strong. The license is *AGPL-3.0* so it's quite nuissance when we want to use it in commercial.

A quick search in github can give some project that use deep learning for ALPR. Unfortunately, those projects are all half-done and not suitable for product.

* [License-Plate-Detect-Recognition-via-Deep-Neural-Networks-accuracy-up-to-99.9](https://github.com/zhubenfu/License-Plate-Detect-Recognition-via-Deep-Neural-Networks-accuracy-up-to-99.9)
* [ANPR](https://github.com/GuiltyNeuron/ANPR)
* [LPRNet_Pytorch](https://github.com/sirius-ai/LPRNet_Pytorch)

There're quick report about openalpr's performance inside the paper as follow:

The [ultimateALPR-SDK](https://github.com/DoubangoTelecom/ultimateALPR-SDK/blob/master/LICENSE) project is amazing. It's worth a try.
