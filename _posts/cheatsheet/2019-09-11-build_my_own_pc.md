2. Mid-range budget, small size
3. High budget, small size 

It was fun but unfortunately it did cost me a lot of time. Here's tips and manual that i found useful, hope it could help some people some day

We need to choose the chip that match your merket segment :

* low budget -> low-end performance
* middle budget -> mid-range performance
* a lot of budget -> high performance and above

Choose the generation as new as possible

* AMD : as in 2019 the newest generation is 4th generation

Always choose the non-suffix chip
