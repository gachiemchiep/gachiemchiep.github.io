# 1. Summary 

This course was originally written at [quita](https://qiita.com/srs/items/5f44440afea0eb616b4a). 
If you find this is useful, go there and give [srs](https://qiita.com/srs) some thumb up.

# 2. Environment

This post is tested under the following Environment:

| Item | Value |
|:-:|:-:|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 5 2600 |
| Ubuntu | 18.04 |
| ROS | Melodic |

# 3. Source code location

The source code of this couse is available at [github](https://github.com/project-srs/ros_lecture)

# 4. Usage

## 4.1. Install ROS

See [02 install](/ros_srs/002_install)。

## 4.2. source code

Our ROS workspace is as followed. 

```bash
/ros_ws/
├── build
├── devel
└── src
    ├── 3rdparty                    <------ dependencies
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── tutorial
          ├── ros_lecture           <----- source code
                ├── adv_lecture
                ├── basic_lecture
                ├── cam_lecture
                ├── hard_lecture
                ├── info_lecture
                ├── laser_lecture
                ├── LICENSE
                ├── nav_lecture
                ├── net_lecture
                ├── obstacle_detector
                ├── plugin_lecture
                ├── py_lecture
                ├── qt_lecture
                ├── sim1_lecture
                ├── sim2_lecture
                ├── sim3_lecture
                ├── vis_lecture
                └── web_lecture

```

Create workspace

```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
```

Download source code

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/tutorial
git clone https://github.com/project-srs/ros_lecture
```

Reload terminal

```shell
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

Build source code

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

If there's any missing dependencies error, we choose between following 2 approaches. 
We're using melodic which is a quite new distribution, so i prefer the second approach

1. Install dependencies using apt
2. Download and put dependencies source code inside 3rdparty

Create eclipse project

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
# generate .project
awk -f $(rospack find mk)/eclipse.awk build/.project > build/.project_with_env && mv build/.project_with_env build/.project
```

Open Eclipse and import into eclipse : *File -> Import Project -> select Build directory*. Detail is at [ros_eclipse](http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#Creating_the_Eclipse_project_files). In my environment, it will look like this

![eclipse](/assets/images/ros_srs/eclipse.png)

## 4.3. How to run

After downloading and building source code, follow 
instruction at each tutorial to run the source code.

## 4.4. Tutorial and file relation

In the beginning of each tutorial, i'll add a simple structure of used files in corresponding tutorial. 
File name is also embedded in the beginning of each code block.
Example is as follow: 

```c++
// basic_lecture/src/basic_simple_talker.cpp
#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"

```
