# 1. 概要

ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS is licensed under an open source, BSD license.

ROS is great tool to control robot. It can run on all support hardware. A "Java/.Net 5" software/library for robotics.


## 1.1. install  
* Simple to install, all packages are available through apt
* program is organized from smaller packages

## 1.2. build  
* ROS build tool =catkin  
This is CMake-based build tool, can link to other library

## 1.3. runtime  
* ROS use publish/subcribe model
* A lot of tools, all free, all unitied  
visulizaton: **rviz**、simulator: **gazebo**、GUI: **rqt**

ROS is very good at:

1. Distributed computation: ROS can use computation resource very effective
2. Software reuse: write code once and run on every hardware that support ROS
3. Rapid testing: ROS can accelarate the testing process
